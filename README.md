I'm Hope Forrester, Client Development Lead at Neiman Marcus, student, and member of Bear Necessities Pediatric Cancer Foundation.
My goal is to comepletely change my career from luxury and retail to finance.
I chose Fintech because I have a background in language and communications that I belive translates to Fintech in an interesting way. If I can master this course, I believe these skills combined will make me an excellent and unique candidate for the opportunities I will be persuing in FinTech.
